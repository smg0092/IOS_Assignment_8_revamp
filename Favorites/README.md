# Favorites

Use a three-tab layout to explore cities, hobbies, and books. On the Home tab, show categories using custom views. Cities appear as cards with background images and text, while hobbies are listed with SF Symbol icons.
Allow users to favorite items with a heart button. Track favorites locally and view them in the Favorites tab. In the Settings tab, provide options to switch dark/light mode and clear all favorites. <br/>
This is a skeleton project that includes all assets you need to build the application.
